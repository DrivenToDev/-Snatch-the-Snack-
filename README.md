**Snatch the Snack**
My first-ever game built using Pygame! Pong inspires this simple yet aesthetic game but with a fun twist: a bouncing carrot and a hungry rabbit. 
The goal is simple: move the rabbit and catch the flying carrot. If the carrot hits the rabbit, you score! How fast can you snack on it? Getting Started
