# -Snatch-the-Snack-
My first-ever game built using PYGAME , and yeah ,its giving simple but aesthetic vibes !This is a cute twist on the classic Pong game-but instead of ball, it's a carrot bouncing around ,and a hungry rabbit trying to catch it. The goal? Collide the carrot with the rabbit and keep the munchies going!
